This project aims to create an interface for analyzing salary revision scenarios or benefit allocation based on predefined criteria.

## Problem
Currently, evaluating salary revisions (e.g., annual increases) or benefit allocations (e.g., transport allowance for employees working in different locations) requires manually filtering and updating Excel files. The process involves adding new columns with criteria (e.g., 5% salary increase), calculating the impact, and determining budget alignment. If not within budget, the process is repeated manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone, especially with a large workforce (1,000+ employees).

## Objective
The goal is to develop an interface where the latest employee data is uploaded from Excel, criteria (e.g., 6% increase) and target groups (e.g., section heads) are defined, and an automated output is generated for all eligible employees. The results should be exportable to Excel for integration with the company's ERP system (SAP).

## Challenge
Create software that can generate compensation and benefit scenarios for our workforce efficiently and accurately.
